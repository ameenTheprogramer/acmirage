                        <strong>BASIM</strong> <br />
                        Originally born in Samarra, Basim lost his mother at a young age and grew up
                        on his own in the streets of Baghdad. Basim admires the Hidden Ones, and dreams
                        of joining them.

                        <strong>ROSHAN</strong><br />
                        After escaping a life of oppression, Roshan became a master assassin at the
                        Hidden Ones’ stronghold, Alamut. Now, she takes Basim under her wing as her
                        first true apprentice.

                        <strong>NEHAL</strong><br />
                        Nehal, as Basim, is a child from the streets. She is a loner, stubborn
                        and determined. As she cares for Basim, she always reminds him that he
                        should never trust anyone but himself.

                        <br />
                        <strong>ALI</strong><br />
                        Ali is the leader of the Zanj rebellion. Apart from being really clever and
                         an erudite, he chose to fight relentlessly and fiercely against the caliphate.
                          He works alongside the Hidden Ones but doesn't respect their credo: to him,
                           freedom goes without any constraints.
